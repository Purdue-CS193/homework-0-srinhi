## Welcome to Srinidhi's Page

My name is Srinidhi Tammana and here are three things I like about CS 19300.

1. The TAs are very helpful and communicative. The class itself is very engaging, informative, and I'm always eager to learn more.
2. The class itself allows us to go into depth about resources and provides proper walkthroughs of everything I need to know, so I don't have to double the work and can just dive straight into what I want to do.
3. There's optional office hours and an entire session every week dedicated to questions that I can ask virtually instead of having to rely on another platform like ED discussions.
